## In collaberation with [The Amazing Professionals](https://github.com/theamazingprofessionals/care-cost)

## Synopsis

Care by Numbers is a web-based application that provides a detailed, data-driven look into the alarming healthcare cost disparity that exists from state to state and hospital to hospital. 
  Starting with a handful of procedures to help highlight these issues, visitors are first greeted with some high-level data charts of cost differences on a country-wide level and are then free to broswer and dig deeper. 
  After finding a dataset of Medicare Inpatient Provider Charges that both shocked and intrigued, we thought it'd be great to visualize this data in a way that would be both informative and fun to play with.
